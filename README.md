## Features

- **Expressive Syntax**: Solis provides an elegant and easy-to-read syntax, allowing developers to focus on creativity rather than boilerplate code.
- **Versatile Data Types**: Explore a variety of data types tailored to different domains, from quantum computing to bioinformatics and beyond.
- **Object-Oriented Magic**: Leverage the power of object-oriented programming with intuitive class and inheritance support.
- **Functional Flourish**: Write concise and powerful code with functional programming constructs, making complex tasks a breeze.
- **Error Resilience**: Harness Solis's built-in error handling mechanism to gracefully manage unexpected situations.
- **File Wizardry**: Seamlessly perform file operations, read from and write to files with ease.

## Installation

Get started with Solis by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solis.git
cd solis
# Make sure you have Python and Sly installed:



pip install sly
Usage
# Run the Solis interpreter and embark on a journey of creativity:



# python solis_interpreter.py
Enter your Solis code at the prompt (>>). For an elegant exit, press Ctrl+C.

Examples
Unleash the potential of Solis with these captivating examples:


let message be "Hello, world!"
let number be 42
let isTrue be true
display "Hello, world!"

define greet(name) {
  display "Hello, " combine name
}
greet("Alice")
```

#Variables
## Declare your world with the let keyword:
```bash
let variableName be value
```
# Functions
## Compose symphonies of logic using the define keyword:


```
define functionName(parameters) {
  # Function body
}
```
# Classes
## Architect your universe with classes using the class keyword:

```
define class ClassName {
  # Class body
}
```
# Quantum Entities
## Dive into the quantum realm with entities that defy classical intuition:

```
let qubit1 be QuantumEntity(state=0)
let qubit2 be QuantumEntity(state=1)
let entangledPair be QuantumEntity(entangle=[qubit1, qubit2])
```
# BioMolecules
## Explore the wonders of life with BioMolecules, rich in structure and interactions:


```
let hemoglobin be BioMolecule(
    type="protein",
    structure="HbA",
    amino_acids=["valine", "leucine", "isoleucine", ...],
    interactions=[
        {"type": "binding", "partner": "oxygen"},
        {"type": "structural", "partner": "heme"}
    ]
)
```
# Neural Networks
## Unravel the mysteries of artificial intelligence with imaginative neural networks:


```
let model be NeuralNetwork(
    layers=[
        {"type": "input", "units": 784},
        {"type": "dense", "units": 128, "activation": "relu"},
        {"type": "dense", "units": 10, "activation": "softmax"}
    ]
)
```
# Paint the canvas of quantum possibilities with particles and entanglements:

solis
```
let canvas be QuantumCanvas(size=[800, 600], background="black")
```
# Create quantum particles on the canvas
```
canvas.add_particle(position=[400, 300], spin="up", color="red")
canvas.add_particle(position=[200, 400], spin="down", color="blue")

```
